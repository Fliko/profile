            <p>codeUp is an application that uses your GitHub data to help create a profile for you.  You can then search for users with similar interests, contact other users,
            create events that others can attend, and search for events in your area. This application was built using a React / Redux front end, NodeJS server, and MongoDB database.
            It was built in three weeks in an Agile team of five engineers utilizing a continuous integration environment where code was tested before merged on TravisCI, pulled from
            GitHub by Docker Cloud and served on a Digital Ocean Server. You can view it on GitHub at https://github.com/Henriettas-Army/CodeUp</p>

            <p>Echoes was a music journal that my team inherited utilizing a React framework, NodeJS server, and PostgreSQL database. Since most of the functionality was already there
            the work that I had done was mostly front-end. Remaking the landing page where I added a multi-layered parallax design, use XHR to send feedback to the client on the state of their form,
            and designing a new logo. UPDATE / TODO: Spotify made changes to their API and the ajax search needs to be replaced with a tokenized server side search.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/balance64/balance"><img src="img/balance.png" alt="Balance"></a>
            <p>Balance was the first application I built from scratch with a team, it is a fitness Journal that helps motivate you along your fitness journey. We used AngularJS, NodeJS server, and a MySQL
            database with knex. I had a hand in just about everything for this app and there is a lot to it. We made the mistake of wanting to add every feature on the internet to this app, fullcalendar.io,
            google graphs, owlCarousel and MaterializeCss, and we wanted more. All this while having a one-week deadline with all engineers working remotely! The most valuable skills I got from this app were
            time management and team communication, but it was also a great experience working with a full MVC framework like angularJS.</p>
